		Chicago Recycling Coalition works to serve the community in an educational and advisory capacity. As local and county governments wrestle with ever more waste and rising disposal costs, we are frequently asked to share our expertise on issues ranging from institutional recycling programs to the purchase of recycled products. What follows is a categorical listing of resources for interested consumers looking to find ways to help build a more sustainable city.
