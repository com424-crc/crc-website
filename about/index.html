      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The Chicago Recycling Coalition is a non-profit organization that
        champions environmentally and fiscally sound management of solid waste
        through research, education, and advocacy, emphasizing waste reduction,
        reuse, recycling, composting, and buying recycled. Back in the early
        1980s, the Chicago Recycling Coalition first began as the Coalition for
        Appropriate Waste Disposal. One of our initial efforts was advocating
        for a landfill moratorium in Chicago. It was passed by the City Council
        in 1984 and is still in effect. Another successful campaign was in the
        mid-nineties, when we worked together with other community groups to
        shut down Chicago's last municipal waste incinerator. (For more history,
        see our Chicago Recycling Timeline.) In the early nineties, we also
        advocated for responsible source-separated municipal recycling programs
        for the city. The result? An excellent recycling ordinance was passed
        for commercial buildings and larger apartment complexes. But at the same
        time, the City Council, under pressure from Mayor Daley, instituted the
        blue bag program, which asked residents to mix bags of garbage and
        recycling together in one bin. We won that battle. The city began the
        change to blue cart recycling in May of 2008, and expanded it citywide
        in 2013.  Now we have the job of ensuring that the blue cart program is
        functioning as intended, as well as ensuring that buildings with 5 or
        more units are providing recycling options as they are required to per
        the "Chicago High Density Residential and Commercial Source Reduction
        and Recycling Ordinance." The Chicago Recycling Coalition is on
        Facebook. Click <a

        We also work to serve the community in an educational and advisory
        capacity. As local and county governments wrestle with ever more waste
        and rising disposal costs, we are frequently asked to share our
        expertise on issues ranging from institutional recycling programs to the
        purchase of recycled products. For the media, we are regularly contacted
        as a reliable source of recycling history, political insights, and hard
        facts. Today we continue to educate and advocate through our newsletter,
        website, and special events. We're not a huge organization, and all of
        us are volunteers. But that doesn't keep us from consistently and
        effectively promoting responsible source-separated recycling and
        composting for Chicago's residents, businesses, and schools. We
        encourage you to join us in these efforts!

      <p>
        The Chicago Recycling Coalition is currently an all volunteer
        organization, with no staff to regularly check email. We do check our
        email periodically, but due to the volume of email we receive, we are
        not able to respond to specific questions about recycling. The City of
        Chicago's recycling information can be found here.  Earth 911's search
        function is very helpful for specific "how do I recycle this?"
        questions. We also suggest visiting our Facebook page, where you can
        engage other like-minded Chicagoans about recycling issues.
