        The Chicago Recycling Coalition champions environmentally and fiscally
        sound management of solid waste through research, education, and
        advocacy, emphasizing waste reduction, reuse, recycling, composting, and
        buying recycled. We work to serve the community in an educational and
        advisory capacity.

      <p>
        Update: CRC has created an issue paper with recommendations for
        evaluating the City of Chicago's managed competition program for Blue
        Cart Recycling. CRC recommends an independent audit of the past 8 years
        of managed competition and details which data from the program should be
        made publicly available.

      <h2>Recycling in Chicago: The Real Story</h2>
      <p>
        May 19, 2016
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have seen WGN’s recent story about how plastic bags are causing
        problems for the City’s recycling efforts. This is not, however, news as
        plastic bags have never been accepted in the blue carts. The real news
        that this story unveils—straight from Department of Streets and
        Sanitation Commissioner Charles Williams—is that “only about 10 to 12
        percent of what is picked up” from the blue carts is being recycled.
        Doing some quick math on the most recent numbers available about
        Chicago’s waste stream, this means that a mere 1.1% to 1.3% of waste
        from City residents who live in one-to-four unit buildings is being
        recycled. This is far less than the already disappointing 11.07%
        recycling rate claimed in that same report, especially compared to the
        diversion rates of other cities like San Francisco (80% in 2012) and
        Portland (70% in 2014). In the WGN story, Commissioner Williams also
        claims that he’d like to see the diversion rate at 80%. Much needs to be
        done by both the City and its residents to get to that goal. The City
        needs to do a better job of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          educating residents about what is accepted in blue carts,
        </li>
        <li>
          enforcing the High Density Residential and Commercial Source Reduction
          and Recycling Ordinance that requires recycling programs in
          residential buildings with 5 or more units and in commercial buildings
        </li>
        <li>
          providing better and more timely information about what is being
          recycled and what’s going to landfills and about the ongoing “managed
          competition” among the private recycling haulers that contract with
          the City to ensure those companies are diverting as much as possible
          from landfills and participating in educational efforts.

              landlord and neighbors to implement a program.

      <h2>The Chicago Recycling Coalition presents a new paper, entitled "Recycling
        Policies in Chicago and Beyond: Failures in Information Collection and
        Provision," by Professor Matthew Shapiro (IIT) and Graduate Student Matt
        Lithgow (DePaul)</h2>
      <p>
        October 9, 2015
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper assesses and evaluates the existing recycling
        metrics for Chicago and other comparable municipalities. The patchwork
        system of Chicago’s recycling collection limits our ability to calculate
        an accurate recycling rate for the city, and this is a function of the
        city’s limited access to and provision of recycling data. Municipalities
        must establish policies that make sense, enact laws that embody those
        policies, create a framework for accountability, and actually hold
        residents and businesses accountable. To this end, Chicago must provide
        recycling and composting services to everyone, recycling must be tracked
        and the attendant data must be made readily available, and its
        educational initiatives must be overhauled in order to decrease
        contamination of the recycling stream.
